### What I learned:
- As my first game jam submission my primary takeaway from this project was how to carefully manage my time in order to finish within the given time frame.
- The project is largely maths based and required systems to create and solve arithmatic puzzles based on a list of constraints. These puzzles were not hard coded and needed to be scaleable as well as instantly solveable before being presented to the user.
- The visual styling of this project is an homage to Windows OS from the 90's, and so particular focus was given to utilising the Unity UI/Canvas system.
- As a game 'edu-tainment' genre, I put large emphasis on being able to design a game with a good balance between the game systems and the learning modules.
